If you are streaming a presentation that has audio, then to get the audio working in:

## Main Room
* Toggle the `Input Level` knob (identified by the `Slide Volume` tape) to adjust the incoming volume. Turning the knob left turns it down, right turns it up.

## Stream
* Unmute the `Desktop Audio 2` mixer input in OBS
* Adjust the blue slider below this input's equalizer as needed.
