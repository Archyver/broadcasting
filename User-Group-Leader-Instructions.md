* A/V equipment can only be manipulated or accessed by a member of the Streaming Team or a designated user group leader who has been authorized and trained previously.
* Before the meetup:
  * Make sure the presenters know that streaming and recording are optional.
  * **At least 1 week** before your scheduled event, confirm whether the speakers consent to streaming and let an A/V volunteer know whether you would like to use the projectors or have the meetup streamed to Twitch. If a volunteer is not available, you will not have access to the A/V equipment or streaming. You can check the status of streaming for your meetup on the [Streaming Volunteer Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=dnJmaWptZnBiZXE0M2VuczlwYzZxOW9sdGtAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ).
  * Let the A/V volunteer know whether the presentation contains any content that cannot be streamed or recorded.
* During the meetup:
  * Turn the microphone on when youâ€™re ready to start streaming, and turn it off at the end of the stream.
  * Read the event intro to the group: https://github.com/techlahoma/event-intro 
  * Watch the [Twitch chat](https://www.twitch.tv/techlahoma) and/or the [#twitch-chat](https://techlahoma.slack.com/messages/twitch-chat) Slack channel during the talk for any questions to relay to the speaker.
  * Remind speakers to repeat questions when they forget.
* The original broadcast on Twitch will expire, so verify that a volunteer has created a [highlight](https://www.twitch.tv/techlahoma/videos/highlight) of the video within one month.
* Be sure that the event page on Meetup contains the talk title, the speaker's name, and a summary of the talk that can be used for the video description (including lightning talks).
