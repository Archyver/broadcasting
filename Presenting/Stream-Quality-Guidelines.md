# Stream Quality Guidelines
It is our goal to make streams hosted by Techlahoma look as professional as possible for our audience, the broadcast committee have written these guidelines to ensure all future broadcasts meet that high standard of quality.

## Visual Assets
* Visual assets must be created at the resolution they will be utilized and not be subject to copyright violation
* Fonts must be legible and free for public use
* No vulgar or offensive imagery may appear in visual assets
* Templates must contain a high-quality and legible logos and image assets. 
* Sponsor logos are allowed, but must be added in a non-intrusive way in the area designated for logos.
* The primary frame must be placed in the top-left corner, with the secondary frame in the bottom-right.
* We recommend a minimum of three video inputs so inputs that need to be adjusted can be adjusted while the other two are live. Live assets should not be adjusted unless absolutely necessary.

## Personnel
* To ensure these guidelines are followed and equipment is not damaged, only trained representatives of the broadcast committee are permitted to use Techlahoma Foundation broadcasting equipment.
* Equipment modifications should always be discussed with the broadcast committee to ensure all operators can troubleshoot issues effectively.
