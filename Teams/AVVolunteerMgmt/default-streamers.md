Default Streamers
---

Every user group that is streamed must have a default streamer. They will follow
the [standard training program](https://github.com/techlahoma/broadcasting/blob/master/Teams/AVVolunteerMgmt/training-policy.md)
for any streaming trainee.

A member of the A/V Volunteer Management Committee will be assigned to a user
group, and it will be their responsibility to train the default streamer, as
well as be the main point of contact between the user group and the Content
Creation committee.

After a user group has selected a default streamer, and they have completed their first
two training sessions, it is up to that default streamer to communicate with their
assigned A/V Volunteer Management Committee representative if they need someone
to cover streaming their user group.
