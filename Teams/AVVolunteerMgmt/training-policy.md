## Training New Volunteers

1. Mandatory 2-session training at any meetup
  * First meeting can be with anyone who is trained to stream, and is meant to be mostly observational.
  * Second meeting must be with a member of A/V Volunteer Mgmt team

1. If the trainee is comfortable, then they will solely stream 2 more meetups on their own.

1. After 2 successfully streamed meetups alone, there will be a Final Review session with a member of the A/V Volunteer Mgmt team to review any lingering questions, and review some of the more detailed concerns, such as:
  * Streaming audio in slides
  * Adding Twitch stream markers
  * Random troubleshooting tips

1. After the Final Review session, the trainee will be completely trained.
