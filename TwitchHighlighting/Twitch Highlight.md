# Creating a Twitch Highlight
A Twitch highlight capturing the entirety of a talk is needed for export and upload to YouTube. These procedures outline the creation of a Twitch highlight.

## [Highlight List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cJqVigTtYIMWPtaYsagYzyYBV1EHO1HTTjpYIt_9Nag)

1. Select a broadcast with no name in the Highlighter Name column.

2. Put your first name in the Highlighter Name column.

3. If there is a link in the Twitch Highlighting Link column, use it. Otherwise, follow steps 1 and 2 in the Video Producer section.

## Video Producer
### 1. On the Dashboard page for the Techlahoma channel, select **Video Producer**.

### 3. Click **New Highlight**.

### 4. Set the **Start** and **End** times according to the beginning and end of the talk itself. 

Exclude the "dead time" before and after the talk. Use your best judgment for any awkward time before the talk or during the Q&A.

### 5. Click **Create Highlights**. 

## Highlight Edit Pane

### 6. Name the highlight using the following format:

```
Talk Title - Speaker Name: Event/Group
```

Use the title from the highlighting spreadsheet. The title must be less than 100 characters, or the export to YouTube will fail.

### 7. Provide a Description, and also provide tags. 

For the Description, go to the [Speaker Form Responses](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10d-1TowAgA2WIqUawxwet9GRmhd2XI8zKxREzxqOuyY/) and see if one is provided by the speaker. It's just a copy + paste, and you know it's correct. This is the preferred way to go. Use the Summary/Abstract/Outline, Speaker's Bio, and Links to Share.

Otherwise, try to find the event on Meetup.com and use any details provided there.

### 8. The category may vary, but **Programming** is a safe bet.

### 9. Click **Save Changes**.

The highlight is now ready for export and upload to YouTube.

## Exporting to YouTube

Don't do this within 24 hours of the original broadcast. If the talk was less than 24 hours ago, just create the highlight and mark "Need to Export?" as "yes" in the spreadsheet.

Add as many tags/keywords as possible when exporting to YouTube. This is how people will find the videos. Sometimes speakers provide them in the Keyword List column in the Speaker Form Responses spreadsheet.

For the tags, you'll always include a few things:
 * "Techlahoma"
 * The group's name
 * The speaker's name
 * A very clear keyword or set of keywords for the content. ( `Bootstrap, Portfolio Site` )
 * Anything else highly relevant.

Make sure you set the video to public not private. Do not break the video into segments.
 
If you have access to the YouTube channel, add the videos to the relevant playlists (month, lightning talks, etc).

For the "Need to Export?" in the spreadsheet:
* If the video appears on Techlahoma's YouTube channel, enter "no" 
* If you're not able to export to YouTube for any reason, enter "yes"
* If you give up on waiting for it to show up on YouTube, leave it blank.
